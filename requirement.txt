# PDF Conversion Feature Requirements

## Overview
A lightweight interface and backend service that converts user-provided PDF files into plain text (`.txt`), Markdown (`.md`), or comma-separated values (`.csv`) while optionally removing unnecessary line breaks.

## Goals
- Enable non-technical users to convert PDFs through a simple web UI.
- Provide consistent conversion outputs across multiple text-based formats.
- Preserve readable text structure even when removing redundant line breaks.

## Scope
- Single PDF upload per conversion request.
- Synchronous conversion triggered from the UI with immediate result download.
- Conversion leverages existing open-source parsing libraries where possible.

## Out of Scope
- Batch or multi-file uploads.
- OCR for scanned PDFs (assumes machine-readable text).
- Long-term storage of uploaded PDFs or converted outputs beyond the user session.

## User Stories
1. As a user, I can upload a PDF and choose `.txt`, `.md`, or `.csv` as the output format so I can reuse the content elsewhere.
2. As a user, I can toggle removal of unnecessary line breaks to get a cleaner output when the PDF contains hard-wrapped text.
3. As a user, I receive immediate feedback if the conversion fails so I know how to proceed.

## Functional Requirements
1. UI provides file picker restricted to `.pdf` and displays the selected file name and size.
2. UI offers mutually exclusive format options for `txt`, `md`, and `csv` with `txt` as the default selection.
3. UI includes a checkbox labeled "Remove unnecessary line breaks" (unchecked by default).
4. UI triggers a backend call on submission and displays loading / success / error states.
5. Backend accepts multipart form data (`file`, `format`, `normalizeLineBreaks`) via POST.
6. Backend performs PDF-to-text extraction, converts text into the chosen format, applies line-break normalization when requested, and returns the file as a downloadable response with appropriate headers.
7. UI automatically downloads the converted file and surfaces failures with actionable messaging.

## Non-Functional Requirements
- Handle PDFs up to 20 MB without timing out under normal server capacity.
- Conversion completes within 10 seconds for a 50-page PDF on reference hardware.
- Tokenize line break removal to avoid collapsing paragraphs or table rows.
- Follow security best practices: validate MIME type, limit file size, and sanitize outputs.

## Dependencies & Constraints
- Use a Node.js-compatible PDF parsing library (e.g., `pdf-parse` or `pdf-lib`).
- Keep the solution serverless-friendly (stateless functions, temporary storage only).
- Ensure the frontend integrates with the existing project build tooling.

## Success Metrics
- Conversion success rate ≥ 98% for machine-readable PDFs.
- Frontend Lighthouse accessibility score ≥ 90 on the conversion page.
- Zero critical errors reported in logs over 1 week of pilot usage.
