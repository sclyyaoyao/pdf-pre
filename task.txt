# PDF Conversion Feature Task Breakdown

## Objectives
Deliver an end-to-end PDF conversion capability comprising a user-facing web view and a serverless-friendly backend function that returns converted files in the chosen format.

## Milestones
1. Technical design approval (requirements review + API contract).
2. Incremental implementation of frontend and backend.
3. QA validation and documentation updates.

## Work Items

### Discovery & Design
- Evaluate PDF parsing libraries compatible with the existing Node.js runtime.
- Define REST endpoint contract (request fields, response headers, error codes).
- Identify reusable UI patterns within the current project for page layout and notifications.

### Frontend Implementation
1. Create a dedicated conversion page or module with file input, format radio buttons, and line-break checkbox.
2. Manage client-side validation (file presence, size limit, extension) and convert button state.
3. Integrate loading and result states, including error messaging and download trigger.
4. Hook into backend endpoint using existing HTTP helper utilities, ensuring CSRF/auth compliance if applicable.

### Backend Implementation
1. Scaffold a new serverless/function handler that accepts multipart form data.
2. Stream uploaded PDF to a temp directory, enforce size/type constraints, and clean up after processing.
3. Extract text using the chosen library and normalize line breaks when requested (collapse single newline characters that appear mid-sentence while preserving paragraph breaks).
4. Format output into `txt`, `md`, or `csv` representations and respond with appropriate MIME type and filename.
5. Implement structured error handling with informative messages for the frontend.

### Quality Assurance
- Add unit tests for line-break normalization and format conversion utilities.
- Write integration tests covering happy path, oversized file rejection, and invalid format selection.
- Perform manual tests with varied PDFs (text-heavy, tables, bullet lists).

### Documentation & Handover
- Update project README or docs with usage instructions and limitations.
- Provide ops runbook notes (log locations, common failure modes).
- Log Jira/task tracker entries with final artifacts and deployment notes.

## Dependencies
- Access to temporary storage for uploaded files (e.g., `/tmp` or cloud storage binding).
- Existing build pipeline for deploying serverless functions.
- QA bandwidth for manual validation.

## Risks & Mitigations
- **PDF parsing accuracy**: choose well-supported library, add regression PDFs for future testing.
- **Large file performance**: enforce size limits and consider streaming conversion to avoid memory spikes.
- **Line-break normalization errors**: implement configurable heuristics and validate with sample documents.

## Definition of Done
- All acceptance criteria in `requirement.md` satisfied.
- Automated tests added/updated and passing locally and in CI.
- Conversion demo validated by stakeholder sign-off.
